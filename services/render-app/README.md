Simple Render with pythonocc0.18.2 and flask

[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/python/black)

# Install
Everything is done inside the docker file.

The geometry which you want to render, needs to be on the fuseki-db in a named graph.


## Idea
Use the existing pythonocc threejs render in an own service where it will generate the shapes from an triple store database.
